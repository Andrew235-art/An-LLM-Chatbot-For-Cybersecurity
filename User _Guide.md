### ‚ú® Key Features & How to Use Them
#### 1. Asking Questions
This is the primary way to interact with Sammy.

#### How to use:

Locate the text input box at the very bottom of the chat interface, labeled "Ask your cybersecurity question here...".

Type your question clearly and concisely.

Press Enter or click the send icon next to the input box.

#### Example questions:

"What is phishing?"

"How can I create a strong password?"

"Tell me about ransomware."

"What should I do if I suspect a cyberattack?"

#### 2. Using Quick Suggestions
For common cybersecurity topics, Sammy provides quick suggestion buttons to get you started.

#### How to use:

Look for the "Quick Suggestions:" section, usually located near the top of the chat area.

Click on any of the suggestion buttons (e.g., "What is phishing?", "Password tips", "Ransomware definition").

Sammy will automatically process this question and provide a response.

#### 3. Understanding Chatbot Responses
Sammy provides clear visual cues to make your conversation smooth.

Typing Indicator: When Sammy is processing your question and generating a response, you will see a "Sammy is typing..." indicator. This lets you know the chatbot is working.

Clear Messages: Responses from Sammy will appear in chat bubbles, clearly distinguishing them from your own messages. The chat history will automatically scroll down as new messages are added, so you always see the latest part of your conversation.

#### 4. Starting a New Conversation
If you want to clear the current chat history and start a fresh conversation with Sammy, you can do so easily.

#### How to use:

Locate the "Start New Conversation" button. It's usually placed just above the input area, below the main chat history.

Click this button.

The chat history will be cleared, and Sammy will greet you again, ready for a new topic.

### üí° Tips for Best Results
Be Specific: The clearer your question, the better Sammy can understand and respond.

One Question at a Time: For best results, try to focus on one main question or topic per message.

Clarification: If Sammy asks for clarification, provide more details to help it understand your query better.

### ‚ùì Basic Troubleshooting
Sammy isn't responding or you see "Sammy is typing..." for longer than expected:

Check your internet connection. Sammy needs an active connection to talk to the AI model.

Try refreshing your web browser page.

If the issue persists, try clicking "Start New Conversation".

"Sorry, I encountered an error." message:

This indicates a problem on the chatbot's side. Try rephrasing your question or starting a new conversation. If the error continues, it might be a temporary issue with the AI service.

We hope Sammy helps you navigate the world of cybersecurity with greater ease and confidence!
