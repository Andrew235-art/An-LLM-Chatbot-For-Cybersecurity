## Introduction

Welcome to **Sammy**, the UICT Cybersecurity Chatbot! This project is an interactive, AI-powered assistant built to empower students and staff at the University of Information and Communication Technology (UICT) with readily accessible and accurate cybersecurity knowledge. Developed using Streamlit and leveraging the advanced capabilities of Google's Gemini Large Language Model, Sammy aims to enhance digital safety and awareness within the UICT community.

## Problem Statement

Students and staff within the community are constantly exposed to various online security dangers. These often show up as tricky online scams like phishing emails or fake messages that try to trick us into giving away our personal details.

We also deal with the risk of harmful software (malware) infecting our devices, including serious threats like ransomware, that can lock up our files. A major concern is also attempts to steal our login details or get unauthorized access to our accounts, or even the institution's official systems and sensitive data.

All these threats really put our personal online activities at risk and can disrupt the smooth digital operations and security of our institution.

## Features

Sammy, the UICT Cybersecurity Chatbot, offers a range of features designed for an intuitive and helpful user experience:

* **Conversational AI:** Powered by Google's Gemini Large Language Model, providing natural and intelligent responses to cybersecurity queries.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit, offering a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate chat environment.

* **Clear Conversation Reset:** A "Start New Conversation" button allows users to easily clear the chat history and begin a new session.

## How It Works

The UICT Cybersecurity Chatbot operates on a client-server model, utilizing Streamlit for the front-end interface and Google's Gemini API for its intelligent core.

1.  **User Interaction:** Users interact with the chatbot via a web-based interface (Streamlit), typing questions or clicking on suggested topics.
2.  **Query Processing:** User queries, along with the conversation history, are sent to the chatbot's backend logic.
3.  **LLM Integration:** The backend sends these queries to the Google Gemini Large Language Model via its API.
4.  **Response Generation:** The Gemini LLM processes the input, generates a relevant cybersecurity response based on its training and the system prompt.
5.  **Display Output:** The chatbot's response is then displayed back to the user in the chat interface.

## System Prompt
The core behavior and persona of Sammy, the UICT Cybersecurity Chatbot, are guided by the following system prompt provided to the Google Gemini Large Language Model:
```
You are Sammy, a friendly and knowledgeable AI-powered chatbot designed to help students
and staff members at the University of Information and Communication Technology (UICT) understand cybersecurity concepts.
Your role is to provide clear, concise, and accurate explanations of cybersecurity topics, tools, and best practices in a way that is easy to understand for users with varying levels of expertise.
You can answer questions about topics like phishing, malware, password security, network security, and data protection.
Additionally, you can provide guidance on how to stay safe online and respond to common cybersecurity threats.
Always maintain a helpful, approachable, and engaging tone.
If a userâ€™s question is unclear, ask for clarification to ensure your response is relevant and useful.
Your knowledge is strictly limited to cybersecurity, and you should not respond to queries outside this domain.
Always address the user by their name to make the conversation more personal and engaging.
```
## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following key technologies:

* **Python:** The primary programming language used for all backend logic and application scripting.
* **Streamlit:** An open-source app framework used for building the interactive web-based user interface.
* **Google Gemini API:** Provides the Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for conversational AI and intelligent response generation.
* **Pillow (PIL):** A Python Imaging Library used for handling image assets (e.g., loading the UICT logo).

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get Sammy up and running on your local Linux machine:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* An active internet connection (required for LLM API access)
* A **Google Gemini API Key (*Specifically the Gemini 2.0 Flash Model API*)**. You can obtain one from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). *Note: For project-specific API access, contact bandrew235@gmail.com. if a shared key is available for request.*

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Andrew235-art/An-LLM-Chatbot-For-Cybersecurity.git](https://github.com/your-username/An-LLM-Chatbot-For-Cybersecurity.git)
    cd An-LLM-chatbot-For-Cybersecurity
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv sammyVenv02
    source sammyVenv02/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project's root directory with the following content:
    ```
    streamlit
    google-generativeai
    Pillow # Required for image handling, even if only used for logo display initially
    (Plus other extra dependencies downloaded automatically)...
    ```
    Then, install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    ### For Windows Users:

If you are setting up on a Windows machine, follow these specific steps for virtual environment and environment variable setup:
